# one_card_data - Made by Dakota Powers
This is a statistics program so that you can visualize and see the statistical data for pulling one card.

I made this to show examples for my stats class. This helped kids in my stats learn what the teacher wished to see.
Currently the numbers cards function does not work, but faces does.

All possible combinations for the first and second number are as follows:
Ace, 2-10, Jack, Queen, King, Faces, Black, Red, Clubs, Hearts, Diamonds, Spades

And you can say if you want:
And, or, none

This is only pulling one card which means if it's black and queen then there are only 2 black queens so that'd be 2/52
