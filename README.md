# one_card_data - Made by Dakota Powers
This is a statistics program so that you can visualize and see the statistical data for pulling one card.

I made this to show examples for my stats class. This helped kids in my stats learn what the teacher wished to see.
Currently the numbers cards function does not work, but faces does.
